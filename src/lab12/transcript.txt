Hi Everyone,

Welcome to lab12. This is the last lab for this semester.

In this lab we will talk about optimized code generation. For specifically three improvements to assignment 7:
    - no more boxing and unboxing for boolean
    - no more boxing and unboxing for integer
        > this means that when expression returns a boolean or integer, it's just the value
          and now unlike assignment 7 we don't need to try to get the value from an object
    - using s1 ... s6 as temporaries
        > this means that we need to cycle through temporaries and if current temporaries
