Hi Everyone,

Welcome to lab #11. In this lab we will think about how to how code
generator works recursively and transfer of control flows.

We will go over
    conditional code generation
    match expression including null arm
    type checking

First lets talk about conditional:

One way to write conditional is the following

  beqz $a0, false   # if false jump to false label
                    # otherwise continue
true
  # then arm of conditional

  b done            # branch unconditionally to done
false:
  # else arm of conditional

done:
  # end of conditional

Trick question. beqz is a macro MIPS instruction. What is the actual MIPS instruction when macro gets expanded?
beq $a0, $zero, false  # register $zero which is an alias for $0 holds the value of zero and it cannot change

What is another way to write this conditional:
> hint: use bne instruction


Now lets talk about mach expression. Remember pattern mach expression can have null arm but it is optional.
if null arm is missing, it will get added by the compiler. You may be wondering why null arm is needed?

The reasons is all other arms expect value to not be null.

In the cool-manual it specifically says that if value is null and no null branch is present then we should
pass the control to runtime exception.

We already did a semantic check which means type of each arm of the branch is less than previous. However, for
